                <em><strong>Many moons ago,</strong></em> existence was born, the existence of everything, relative or non-relative, everything we see around us. An incident termed Big Bang occurred, bringing us to the terms that we all are born of the same. Our very existence has the same roots. The inextricable soul of the universe was parted into each of us with the explosion. The soul, the fuel to everything.


			</p><figure class="size-4"><img src="cover.jpg"></figure><p>By Paulo Coelho, a book that reveals that each and every object on earth has a destiny, an intent in this four dimensional world. Time is what decides the way of destiny, when to begin and when to end. Who is an alchemist?  A person capable of alchemy? A person with magical capabilities? That is what the dictionary says. I believe Alchemist is a person who can converse in the language of the world, who possess the capability to listen and reciprocate to the soul that exists in all of us, someone capable of freeing themselves towards achieving their dreams.  When was the last time we questioned the purpose of our life, our meaning in this world? Why do we wake up every day? Even though we do not know what the day has in store for us. What time has kept hidden from us, what every moment of our life would reveal to us. We forget our roots, we forget to take a minute and attach ourselves to the soul, we forget to listen to what our heart has to say, we forget that our life is made up of moments, not seconds. We forget ourselves and cave in to the desires of this world. We all want to achieve our goals without wanting to realise it, without wanting to walk the path, to reach the end without dripping sweat.
                
                <blockquote>“Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure.”</blockquote></p>
                
                <p>The book in each line reminds us to listen to the soul for it knows everything, the answers to all your questions. The soul reveals the map to our destiny. To never lose hope, to always chase our dreams no matter what may come, is what that Andalusian shepherd teaches us. Even though losing his fortune thrice, he never gave up. He continued forward, albeit he had options to settle down and have a routine life, but the realisation of never being able to achieve his dream and the constant fear of regretting it later fuelled him to move forward. We should always learn to make our dreams our priority because that is our light at the end of the tunnel. When we walk that path, break down the walls of suffering and endure the pain, we always learn a lesson for the path ahead.
                
                </p><blockquote>“The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.”</blockquote>
                
                <blockquote>Most of us never get up, give up too easy. Convince ourselves that the pain, it’s worthless. We lose the spirit to move ahead, the inspiration to make the next step, the courage to take the next risk. We forget what we have achieved, our strengths in the past, the risks we have already undertaken and walked through. We, undermine ourselves.</blockquote>
                
                <blockquote>“Don't give in to your fears. If you do, you won't be able to talk to your heart.”</blockquote><p>
                
                In the essence all I want to express if to follow your heart. Walk wherever it leads you. Always have hope especially in the worst of situations, because you are tested at every moment of your life. Get up even if you fall more than eight times, learn from your failures rather than backing up because of them. Listen to your heart always, yes use your brain for logical answers but the path, always follow your heart. The way of life is designed to cause you to quit, to back up, but you must move forward.
                
                Your life is a book, the people you meet make the chapters, each chapter bringing with it sundry circumstances imparting a lesson for the next one.
                
                Write it as creative as you can till end.
